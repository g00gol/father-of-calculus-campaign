				<h1>Isaac Newton's Early Life</h1>
				<p>
					Born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, England was Isaac Newton. He was a son to
					an uneducated but wealthy farmer, who died some time before Newton was
					born. This caused his mother to remarry, and Newton was left with his
					grandmother. Although Newton was not the smartest at his school, he
					was offered to attend Trinity College Cambridge. He wanted to study
					law, but his mother would not pay for his education, leaving him to
					work as a servant during his time at college.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, Newton became incredibly curious about mathematics after
					buying a math book and not understanding the information it contained.
					He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1665 but was prevented from further
					education due to the plague. His college was closed due to the highly
					contagious disease (as I am sure we can all relate to), and Newton
					went home. He took this time in quarantine to pursue his own ideas in
					mathematics, physics, optics, and astronomy. When the college
					reopened, he took a fellowship to earn his master’s degree.
				</p>
				<p>
					He had finished working on his three laws of motion by 1666, and later
					his works on universal gravitation, diffraction of light, centripetal
					force, and many other variations of studies. He became a leader in
					scientific research after all his remarkable works. However, his work
					came to a halt when he suffered a nervous breakdown in 1679.
				</p>
				<p>
					After regaining his health, he once again continued to study and spoke
					out against King James II when he only wanted Roman Catholics to be in
					positions of government and academia. Once William of Orange chased
					King James II out of England, Newton was elected to Parliament,
					leading him to become more interested with the life of politics than
					research.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1693, Newton suffered from another nervous breakdown and ultimately
					retired from research. Newton was a man who was torn between his want
					for fame and fear of criticism, and he resisted publishing his work
					immediately because of this. He often felt like he had to defend his
					work against plagiarism, one dispute like this being between him and
					Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz about calculus. This dispute dominated the
					last years of Newton's life. Newton died in 1727.
