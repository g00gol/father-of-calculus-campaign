				<p style="font-size: 15px">January 4, 1643 - March 31, 1727</p>
				<h1>Isaac Newton's Early Life</h1>
				<p>
					Born in 1643 in Woolsthorpe, England was Isaac Newton. He was a son to
					an uneducated but wealthy farmer, who died some time before Newton was
					born. This caused his mother to remarry, and Newton was left with his
					grandmother. Although Newton was not the smartest at his school, he
					was offered to attend Trinity College Cambridge. He wanted to study
					law, but his mother would not pay for his education, leaving him to
					work as a servant during his time at college.
				</p>
				<p>
					Meanwhile, Newton became incredibly curious about mathematics after
					buying a math book and not understanding the information it contained.
					He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1665 but was prevented from further
					education due to the plague. His college was closed due to the highly
					contagious disease (as I am sure we can all relate to), and Newton
					went home. He took this time in quarantine to pursue his own ideas in
					mathematics, physics, optics, and astronomy. When the college
					reopened, he took a fellowship to earn his master’s degree.
				</p>
				<p>
					He had finished working on his three laws of motion by 1666, and later
					his works on universal gravitation, diffraction of light, centripetal
					force, and many other variations of studies. He became a leader in
					scientific research after all his remarkable works. However, his work
					came to a halt when he suffered a nervous breakdown in 1679.
				</p>
				<p>
					After regaining his health, he once again continued to study and spoke
					out against King James II when he only wanted Roman Catholics to be in
					positions of government and academia. Once William of Orange chased
					King James II out of England, Newton was elected to Parliament,
					leading him to become more interested with the life of politics than
					research.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1693, Newton suffered from another nervous breakdown and ultimately
					retired from research. Newton was a man who was torn between his want
					for fame and fear of criticism, and he resisted publishing his work
					immediately because of this. He often felt like he had to defend his
					work against plagiarism, one dispute like this being between him and
					Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz about calculus. This dispute dominated the
					last years of Newton's life. Newton died in 1727.

				<h1>Isaac’s Incredible Innovations</h1>
				<p>
					During the Great Plague of 1665-1666, Newton accomplished many things:
					he discovered a new theory of light, uncovered and quantified
					gravitation, and forged a world-changing approach to mathematics:
					infinitesimal calculus. Newton’s invention of calculus was the most
					important link between his laws of motion and universal gravitation.
					In fact, his focus on gravity and laws of motion brought him to his
					breakthrough in calculus. He once tried to describe the speed of a
					falling object; however, rate of change and the issue of movement had
					not been investigated yet, so this led him to try and fill this void
					of mathematics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Newton began incorporating planetary ellipses into his initial theory
					to try and explain the orbits of the planets. By using calculus,
					Newton explained the movement of planets and why the orbits were in
					the shape of an ellipse. This led him to his discovery explaining that
					the gravitational force that keeps us on the ground is the same force
					that causes the planets to orbit the sun and the moon to orbit the
					Earth.
				</p>
				<p>
					When Newton developed the idea of calculus and its focus on the rate
					of change, it helped tremendously with his previous work of physics,
					and he found that both mathematics and physics are ultimately linked
					together through calculus. Calculus was, and still is, very important
					because it allowed mathematicians and engineers to understand the
					motion and dynamic change in the ever-changing world around us, like
					planetary orbits and fluids.

				<h2>Major Contributions:</h2>
				<p>
					The Average Slope of a Curve - Newton’s initial problem was that the
					slope of a curve was always varying, and there was no method to
					pinpoint the exact slope at any one individual point on a curve, like
					the slope of a tangent line to the curve at that point. Newton was
					able to calculate a derivative function which gave the slope at any
					point of a function, which is part of differential calculus or
					differentiation (which Newton called the “method of fluxions”). In a
					case considering time and distance, the slope would represent the
					speed of the object at a certain point.
				</p>
				<p>
					Method of Fluents - This was the “opposite” of differentiation and was
					part of integral calculus or integration. Integration and
					differentiation are the two main operations of calculus.
					Differentiation and integration are inverse operations, so that, if a
					function is first integrated and then differentiated (or vice versa),
					the original function is retrieved, as stated by Newton’s Fundamental
					Theorem of Calculus.

				<h1>Is Isaac the "Father of Calculus"?</h1>
				<p>
					The controversy remains that Isaac Newton was the first to discover
					and use calculus, but Wilhelm Leibniz was the first to publish his
					works and spread it across Europe. The most modern version of calculus
					was drawn out by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. However, my argument can
					be compared to the likes of psychology: Wilhelm Wundt was deemed the
					father of psychology, yet numerous people have come up with their own
					ideas afterwards to better improve how we study psychology. The same
					kind of logic can be applied to calculus. Newton went through two
					nervous breakdowns during his life and was torn between his desire for
					fame and his fear for criticism, which is why he hesitated on
					publishing his work. This can be understandable, especially in a world
					full of many things to discover and put your name on. I believe that
					Newton should be deemed the father of calculus because he came up with
					many of the original concepts needed for calculus.
				</p>
				<p>
					One theory and discovery, like Newton’s calculus, can act as a
					starting point for others that come after it. Without the use of
					calculus, Albert Einstein would not have been able to derive his
					astonishing theory of relativity. Nowadays, calculus is used in many
					fields, including math, science, engineering, biology, and more.
					Social sciences must rely on calculus heavily to calculate birth rates
					and death rates. The same can be said about economic forecasts and
					many other fields, like engineering and medical industries.
					Personally, I believe that Isaac Newton and his invention of calculus
					has had an incredible impact on the world around us and how we see it,
					or measure it, if you will.
