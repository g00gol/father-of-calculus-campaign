				<h1>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's Early Life</h1>
				<p>
					Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a German mathematician renown as a
					prodigy for his works in philosophy, engineering, physics, law, and
					politics, among other things. He was born in Saxony, Germany on July
					1, 1646. His father and mother were both prominent figures in the city
					as the former was a professor of moral philosophy and the latter being
					the daughter of a successful local lawyer. Unfortunately, when Leibniz
					was only 6, his father died.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite this, Leibniz was considered a prodigy in his childhood,
					studying Greek works and Latin at the young age of 12. At the age of
					14, he studied philosophy, math, and law at the University of Leipzig;
					when he applied for a doctorate, he was denied due to his age.
					However, after Leibniz presented an incredible thesis to the
					University of Altdorf, the professors promptly awarded him a doctorate
					and professorship.
				</p>
				<p>
					Leibniz’s life speaks in ways not many can, and his contributions lay
					the foundation for modern mathematics – or rather, the world as a
					whole – in which we carry on today. At the age of 70, Gottfried
					Wilhelm Leibniz died in Hanover on November 14, 1716.

				<h1>Wilhelm's Wondrous Works</h1>
				<p>
					It is not lightly put when I describe Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's
					works, having laid the foundation to our understanding of contemporary
					calculus. Though, Leibniz primarily contributed work to philosophy and
					logic while working as a politician in the great majority of his day.
					Despite this, somehow, he continually spared hours to study and work
					on mathematics and later developed a system of infinitesimal calculus.
					Leibniz also restored the ancient method of solving equations through
					matrices and developed the use of binary. independently from his
					"rival" Sir Isaac Newton. I find it important to note that both
					Leibniz and Newton held off on publishing their works, but Leibniz had
					published his ideas in 1684 while Newton's works were published in the
					18th century.
				</p>
				<img src="../images/wilhelm-notes.png" alt="wilhelm's notes" />
				<p>
					By many accounts, Leibniz is said to have known and be fully aware of
					Newton's works in calculus. However, it is unstated that either men
					plagiarized the other's work; furthermore, each presents specifics of
					calculus that are particularly theirs. In Leibniz's case, he used and
					created the contemporary notation of calculus. For this fact, he had
					much improved upon the clumsy and lacking notation Newton had used.
					Along with this, Leibniz also re-introduced a form of arranging linear
					equations we know as a matrix, allowing easier manipulation and
					solution. In effect, over 300 years later, our contemporary and modern
					form of calculus most directly compares to that of Leibniz.

				<h1>Is Wilhelm the "Father of Calculus"?</h1>
				<p>
					For what it is worth, both men sought to create their respective
					versions of calculus and succeeded, and they have shaped the world
					today from three millenniums ago. However, I believe that Gottfried
					Wilhelm Leibniz deserves the recognition as the "Father of Calculus"
					as he has subsequently provided the most concurrent form of calculus
					while providing the clearest. While Newton may have, on record,
					conceived of the idea of calculus before him, Leibniz was still the
					ultimate progenitor of modern and complete calculus: what Newton
					writes seems to be incomplete, while Leibniz's was complete and
					coherent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Furthermore, I must speak of this debate in another way. As Leibniz
					published his works, he received attacks from Newton that accused him
					of plagiarism. In extension, Newton was the president of the Royal
					Society in London that was asked to arbitrate between the claims. The
					ruling, logically biased, gave credit to Newton for calculus's
					conception and credit of publication to Wilhelm. However, the
					aforementioned conception of calculus was brittle and unpolished
					unlike the publication of Wilhelm's work.
				</p>
				<p>
					In an extended analogy, Newton's findings may have been the foundation
					for the modern airplane but Leibniz was the one to piece and build the
					structure. For this, Newton simply conceptualized an idea that had no
					start or end while Leibniz built a reality from the theories Newton
					had began.
